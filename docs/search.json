It is awarded by the U.S. Department of Education to help eligible low-income students pay for college costs, including tuition, fees, room and board, and other educational expenses."

The maximum amount for the 2021–2022 award year is $6,495. The maximum amount of the grant usually depends on the EFC and several other factors, including cost of attendance, the amount of time the student plans to attend college, whether it is a full academic year, and whether one is a full-time or part-time student.[6] Once one has been considered eligible, the money can be obtained a couple of ways: the student’s school can apply Pell Grant funds to school costs, pay the student directly, usually by check, or combine these methods.\nThe school must tell the student in writing how much the award will be and how and when it will be paid, and it must disburse Pell Grant funds once a semester/term or twice during the academic year.[6] Under certain circumstances, Pell funds can also be used to fund Career Pathways programs and support services.[21]"

    "text": "Dumbbell Chart: Visualizing variation of award amounts\nI want to create a dumbbell chart, inspired by this BBC article (see the chart “Earnings vary across unis even within subject”). The idea is to illustrate the variance of Pell Grant within the same state.\nI’ve never created a dumbbell chart before, so I’m following this tutorial as a start.\n\npell_max_min <- pell %>% \n    filter(year == 2017) %>% \n    mutate(award_per_person = award / recipient) %>% \n    select(state, name, award_per_person) %>% \n    group_by(state) %>% \n    summarise(max = max(award_per_person, na.rm = TRUE),\n              min = min(award_per_person, na.rm = TRUE),\n              avg = mean(award_per_person, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% \n    ungroup() %>% \n    mutate(diff = max - min) %>% \n    mutate(state = fct_reorder(state, diff)) %>% \n    pivot_longer(cols = c(max, min)) %>% \n    rename(type = name, \n           award_per_person = value)\n\nhead(pell_max_min)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  state   avg  diff type  award_per_person\n  <fct> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>            <dbl>\n1 AK    3866. 1650. max              4627.\n2 AK    3866. 1650. min              2978.\n3 AL    4186. 4039. max              6247.\n4 AL    4186. 4039. min              2208.\n5 AR    4165. 3477. max              6114.\n6 AR    4165. 3477. min              2637 \n\n\nApparently, we need two tibbles. Each tibble holds the data for one end of the dumbbell chart. So we need one tibble for max and one for min.\n\nmax_award <- pell_max_min %>% filter(type == \"max\")\nmin_award <- pell_max_min %>% filter(type == \"min\")\n\nhead(min_award)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  state   avg  diff type  award_per_person\n  <fct> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>            <dbl>\n1 AK    3866. 1650. min              2978.\n2 AL    4186. 4039. min              2208.\n3 AR    4165. 3477. min              2637 \n4 AS    4501.    0  min              4501.\n5 AZ    3918. 3420. min              2205.\n6 CA    4069. 6730  min              1162 \n\n\nNow, the data is ready for basic dumbbell plot. We’ll use ggplot2 package, geom_point() to create the two ends of the dumbbell, and geom_segment() to create a connection between the two ends.\n\npell_max_min %>% \n    ggplot() +\n    \n    geom_point(aes(x = award_per_person, \n                   y = state, \n                   color = type),\n               size = 2, show.legend = TRUE) +\n    \n    geom_segment(data = min_award,\n                 aes(x = award_per_person, y = state,\n                     xend = max_award$award_per_person,\n                     yend = max_award$state),\n                 color = \"#aeb6bf\",\n                 size = 2.5,\n                 alpha = 0.5) +\n    \n    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n    \n    scale_color_discrete(name = \"Amount\",\n                         labels = c(\"Max\", \"Min\")) +\n    \n    labs(x = \"Award per student (USD)\",\n         y = \"State\",\n         title = \"Pell Grant awards vary across colleges within the same state\",\n         subtitle = \"Award amount per student in 2017\") +\n    \n    theme_minimal()"
