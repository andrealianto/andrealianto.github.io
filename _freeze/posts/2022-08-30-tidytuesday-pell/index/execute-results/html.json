It is awarded by the U.S. Department of Education to help eligible low-income students pay for college costs, including tuition, fees, room and board, and other educational expenses.\n\n## Load Data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\npell <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-08-30/pell.csv') %>% \n    janitor::clean_names()\n\npell\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 100,474 × 6\n   state    award recipient name                                   session  year\n   <chr>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>                                  <chr>   <dbl>\n 1 AK     197233.       109 Alaska Pacific University              1999-00  1999\n 2 AK     133148.        69 Alaska Vocational Technical Center     1999-00  1999\n 3 AK     107287         72 Sheldon Jackson College                1999-00  1999\n 4 AK    3425149.      1920 University of Alaska - Anchorage       1999-00  1999\n 5 AK    2441864       1256 University of Alaska at Fairbanks      1999-00  1999\n 6 AK     353170        221 University of Alaska at Southeast      1999-00  1999\n 7 AL    5520921.      2369 Alabama Agricultural & Mechanical Uni… 1999-00  1999\n 8 AL    1548659.       837 Alabama Southern Community College     1999-00  1999\n 9 AL    7164037.      3236 Alabama State University               1999-00  1999\n10 AL    1514341        854 Athens State University                1999-00  1999\n# … with 100,464 more rows\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Explore Data\n\nOur goal is to understand how Pell Grant award in the US changes across time and how it is related the location or type of colleges.\n\nHow many students received the Pell Grant award?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npell %>% \n    select(year, recipient) %>% \n    group_by(year) %>% \n    summarise(total_recipient = sum(recipient)) %>% \n    ggplot(aes(year, total_recipient)) +\n    geom_col() +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n    theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/explore-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHow much Pell Grant money is awarded each year?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npell %>% \n    select(year, award) %>% \n    group_by(year) %>% \n    summarise(total_award = sum(award, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% \n    ggplot(aes(year, total_award)) +\n    geom_col() +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n    theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/explore-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice that the total award dollar jumped way more than the total number of award recipients in 2009.

In California, we can see a bigger difference across universities.\n\nOkay, so now that I have a rough feel of the data, I'd like to visualize the range of Pell Grant award amount that a student can expect in different states.\n\n## Dumbbell Chart: Visualizing variation of award amounts\n\nI want to create a dumbbell chart, inspired by [this BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/education-44395621) (see the chart \"Earnings vary across unis even within subject\"). The idea is to illustrate the variance of Pell Grant within the same state.\n\nI've never created a dumbbell chart before, so I'm following [this tutorial](https://r-graph-gallery.com/web-extended-dumbbell-plot-ggplot2.html) as a start.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npell_max_min <- pell %>% \n    filter(year == 2017) %>% \n    mutate(award_per_person = award / recipient) %>% \n    select(state, name, award_per_person) %>% \n    group_by(state) %>% \n    summarise(max = max(award_per_person, na.rm = TRUE),\n              min = min(award_per_person, na.rm = TRUE),\n              avg = mean(award_per_person, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% \n    ungroup() %>% \n    mutate(diff = max - min) %>% \n    mutate(state = fct_reorder(state, diff)) %>% \n    pivot_longer(cols = c(max, min)) %>% \n    rename(type = name, \n           award_per_person = value)\n\nhead(pell_max_min)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  state   avg  diff type  award_per_person\n  <fct> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>            <dbl>\n1 AK    3866. 1650. max              4627.\n2 AK    3866. 1650. min              2978.\n3 AL    4186. 4039. max              6247.\n4 AL    4186. 4039. min              2208.\n5 AR    4165. 3477. max              6114.\n6 AR    4165. 3477. min              2637 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nApparently, we need two tibbles. Each tibble holds the data for one end of the dumbbell chart. So we need one tibble for max and one for min.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmax_award <- pell_max_min %>% filter(type == \"max\")\nmin_award <- pell_max_min %>% filter(type == \"min\")\n\nhead(min_award)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  state   avg  diff type  award_per_person\n  <fct> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>            <dbl>\n1 AK    3866. 1650. min              2978.\n2 AL    4186. 4039. min              2208.\n3 AR    4165. 3477. min              2637 \n4 AS    4501.    0  min              4501.\n5 AZ    3918. 3420. min              2205.\n6 CA    4069. 6730  min              1162 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, the data is ready for basic dumbbell plot. We'll use `ggplot2` package, `geom_point()` to create the two ends of the dumbbell, and `geom_segment()` to create a connection between the two ends.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npell_max_min %>% \n    ggplot() +\n    \n    geom_point(aes(x = award_per_person, \n                   y = state, \n                   color = type),\n               size = 2, show.legend = TRUE) +\n    \n    geom_segment(data = min_award,\n                 aes(x = award_per_person, y = state,\n                     xend = max_award$award_per_person,\n                     yend = max_award$state),\n                 color = \"#aeb6bf\",\n                 size = 2.5,\n                 alpha = 0.5) +\n    \n    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n    \n    scale_color_discrete(name = \"Amount\",\n                         labels = c(\"Max\", \"Min\")) +\n    \n    labs(x = \"Award per student (USD)\",\n         y = \"State\",\n         title = \"Pell Grant awards vary across colleges within the same state\",\n         subtitle = \"Award amount per student in 2017\") +\n    \n    theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/dumbbell-viz-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## More ideas!\n\nWoohoo, I created my first dumbbell chart.\n\nIf I had more time, here are some things I would want to explore:\n\n-   **Distribution** of award amount per person in different states. While range is great, distribution can tell more story. Inspiration: [Julia Silge's blog](https://juliasilge.com/blog/pay-gap-uk/) on gender pay gap in the UK.\n\n-   **Investigate the jump** in amount awarded per student in 2009. Was it due to change in administration? Was there a new bill to increase higher education subsidy?\n\n-   **Bump chart** - to see the award trend for different colleges or states over time.\n\n-   Visualize the **data on the US map**.\n\n-   Investigate if a certain **category of colleges** awarded more grant than other categories. We can use [the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education](https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/downloads.php), download the 2021 classification data and join the table with our data set.\n\n-   Investigate the actual amount awarded **vs the maximum possible award**.\n",
