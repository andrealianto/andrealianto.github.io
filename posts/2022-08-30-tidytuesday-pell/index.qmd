## Background

This week, we look into the Pell Grant awards data.

According to [usnews.com](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-pell-grant):

> The Pell Grant is a form of need-based federal [financial aid](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/an-ultimate-guide-to-understanding-college-financial-aid) that typically does not have to be repaid, which makes it highly desirable. It is awarded by the U.S. Department of Education to help eligible low-income students pay for college costs, including tuition, fees, room and board, and other educational expenses.

## Load Data

```{r}
#| label: load-data
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)

pell <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-08-30/pell.csv') %>% 
    janitor::clean_names()

pell
```

## Explore Data

Our goal is to understand how Pell Grant award in the US changes across time and how it is related the location or type of colleges.

How many students received the Pell Grant award?

```{r}
#| label: explore-1
#| warning: false

pell %>% 
    select(year, recipient) %>% 
    group_by(year) %>% 
    summarise(total_recipient = sum(recipient)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(year, total_recipient)) +
    geom_col() +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
    theme_minimal()

```

How much Pell Grant money is awarded each year?

```{r}
#| label: explore-2
#| warning: false

pell %>% 
    select(year, award) %>% 
    group_by(year) %>% 
    summarise(total_award = sum(award, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(year, total_award)) +
    geom_col() +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
    theme_minimal()

```

Notice that the total award dollar jumped way more than the total number of award recipients in 2009. I'm guessing the dollar awarded per student possibly increased significantly in 2009. Let's check.

```{r}
#| label: explore-3
#| warning: false

pell %>% 
    select(year, award, recipient) %>% 
    group_by(year) %>% 
    summarise(award_per_recipient = sum(award, na.rm = TRUE) / sum(recipient)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(year, award_per_recipient)) +
    geom_col() +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
    theme_minimal()

```

Looks like between 1999 to 2006, the grant awarded per student was stagnant below \$2,500.Only from 2009 onwards, the grant awarded per student started to increase year-on-year.

Next, I'd like to understand top states that award the largest Pell Grant, in terms of dollar value and number of recipients. Let's see what they are in 2017.

```{r}
#| label: explore-4
#| warning: false

pell %>% 
    filter(year == 2017) %>% 
    select(state, award, recipient) %>% 
    group_by(state) %>% 
    summarise(total_award = sum(award, na.rm = TRUE),
              total_recipient = sum(recipient)) %>% 
    arrange(-total_recipient)
```

Which schools in California and Texas that awarded the largest Pell Grant in 2017?

```{r}
#| label: explore-5
#| warning: false

pell %>% 
    filter(year == 2017 & state %in% c("CA", "TX")) %>% 
    select(state, name, award) %>%
    group_by(state) %>% 
    slice_max(award, n = 10) %>%
    ungroup() %>% 
    ggplot(aes(award, fct_reorder(name, award), fill = state)) +
    geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(~state, ncol=1, scales = "free")
```

In the same state, the amount of Pell Grant award differs by university. Does the amount per student also differ a lot across universities? Let's check again for California and Texas.

```{r}
#| label: explore-6
#| warning: false

pell %>% 
    filter(year == 2017 & state %in% c("CA", "TX")) %>% 
    select(state, name, award, recipient) %>%
    mutate(award_per_person = award / recipient) %>% 
    group_by(state) %>% 
    slice_max(award_per_person, n = 10) %>%
    ungroup() %>% 
    ggplot(aes(award_per_person, fct_reorder(name, award_per_person), fill = state)) +
    geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
    facet_wrap(~state, ncol=1, scales = "free")
```

In Texas, the award per student looks roughly similar. In California, we can see a bigger difference across universities.

Okay, so now that I have a rough feel of the data, I'd like to visualize the range of Pell Grant award amount that a student can expect in different states.

## Dumbbell Chart: Visualizing variation of award amounts

I want to create a dumbbell chart, inspired by [this BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/education-44395621) (see the chart "Earnings vary across unis even within subject"). The idea is to illustrate the variance of Pell Grant within the same state.

I've never created a dumbbell chart before, so I'm following [this tutorial](https://r-graph-gallery.com/web-extended-dumbbell-plot-ggplot2.html) as a start.

```{r}
#| label: dumbbell-prep
#| warning: false

pell_max_min <- pell %>% 
    filter(year == 2017) %>% 
    mutate(award_per_person = award / recipient) %>% 
    select(state, name, award_per_person) %>% 
    group_by(state) %>% 
    summarise(max = max(award_per_person, na.rm = TRUE),
              min = min(award_per_person, na.rm = TRUE),
              avg = mean(award_per_person, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    mutate(diff = max - min) %>% 
    mutate(state = fct_reorder(state, diff)) %>% 
    pivot_longer(cols = c(max, min)) %>% 
    rename(type = name, 
           award_per_person = value)

head(pell_max_min)
```

Apparently, we need two tibbles. Each tibble holds the data for one end of the dumbbell chart. So we need one tibble for max and one for min.

```{r}
#| label: dumbbell-separate-tibble
#| warning: false

max_award <- pell_max_min %>% filter(type == "max")
min_award <- pell_max_min %>% filter(type == "min")

head(min_award)
```

Now, the data is ready for basic dumbbell plot. We'll use `ggplot2` package, `geom_point()` to create the two ends of the dumbbell, and `geom_segment()` to create a connection between the two ends.

```{r}
#| label: dumbbell-viz
#| warning: false
#| fig-height: 10

pell_max_min %>% 
    ggplot() +
    
    geom_point(aes(x = award_per_person, 
                   y = state, 
                   color = type),
               size = 2, show.legend = TRUE) +
    
    geom_segment(data = min_award,
                 aes(x = award_per_person, y = state,
                     xend = max_award$award_per_person,
                     yend = max_award$state),
                 color = "#aeb6bf",
                 size = 2.5,
                 alpha = 0.5) +
    
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
    
    scale_color_discrete(name = "Amount",
                         labels = c("Max", "Min")) +
    
    labs(x = "Award per student (USD)",
         y = "State",
         title = "Pell Grant awards vary across colleges within the same state",
         subtitle = "Award amount per student in 2017") +
    
    theme_minimal()
```

## More ideas!

Woohoo, I created my first dumbbell chart.

If I had more time, here are some things I would want to explore:

-   **Distribution** of award amount per person in different states. While range is great, distribution can tell more story. Inspiration: [Julia Silge's blog](https://juliasilge.com/blog/pay-gap-uk/) on gender pay gap in the UK.

-   **Investigate the jump** in amount awarded per student in 2009. Was it due to change in administration? Was there a new bill to increase higher education subsidy?

-   **Bump chart** - to see the award trend for different colleges or states over time.

-   Visualize the **data on the US map**.

-   Investigate if a certain **category of colleges** awarded more grant than other categories. We can use [the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education](https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/downloads.php), download the 2021 classification data and join the table with our data set.

-   Investigate the actual amount awarded **vs the maximum possible award**.
