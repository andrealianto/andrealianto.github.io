## Hello, there 👋🏼

I'm a Trust & Safety Analyst at Google. I build data pipelines, design dashboards, and manage operations to identify badness on Search at scale.

I love playing with data, making charts, and chatting about technical topics in general.

This blog is to share snippets of my learning journey in data analysis (mostly in R).

Glad to have you here!
